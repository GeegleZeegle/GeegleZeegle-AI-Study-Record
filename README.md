## 📖 Study Format

### 1. Abstract Reading  
We rotate weekly, with each member summarizing key insights from a research paper's abstract and uploading it to Discord.

### 2. Paper Reviews  
- Collaborative work on **Notion** followed by uploads to GitHub.
- Two members alternate presenting papers each week.
- Presenters must upload materials by **Tuesday midnight** to allow comments and questions from members (at least one question per person).
- Presentations last **40-50 minutes**.

### 3. Quiz Session  
Presenters prepare 2-3 questions about the core concepts, methodology, and findings to engage members in a review session.

### 4. Code Review & Articles  
- Review code from Kaggle or GitHub based on theories from the paper.
- Presenters upload **Colab notebooks** a day in advance for hands-on activities.
- Unrelated yet interesting articles, blogs, or news related to AI are also welcome!
